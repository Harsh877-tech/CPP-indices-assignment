Answer:  I think I'd give myself a B. The code works for the test cases, which is good. But I'm not 100% sure it's the most efficient way to solve the problem

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.

Answer: there were few problems with complexity initially. I started by trying to use two for-loops to check every pair of numbers, but that felt really slow. After some Googling, I found out about using a hash map, which seemed faster but was trickier to implement.
I struggled most with understanding how to use the unordered_map in C++. It took me a while to figure out how to check if a key exists and how to add new key-value pairs. I'm still not totally confident about the time complexity of my solution.
